<h1>My fourth year and final project: Peadiatric Hospital System</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a system designed that covers all the different departments of a pediatric hospital, i.e. the receptionist, the nurse, lab, doctor and the pharmacy. Finance department is the only part that was not implemented.</p>
<p><b>P.S.</b> Its a school project</p>
<h2>The receptionist</h2>
<p>The system allows inputs of basic data like names, date of birth if a new patient and selects from the existing if a not a new patient. Then the system updates the waiting list of a nurse.</p>
<h2>The nurse</h2>
<p>The recieved patient goes to nurse to take necessary test incase of sickness like temperature and blood pressure, andthen the system updates the waiting list of a doctor with the details or incase of a vaccine, just administered if taken before and if its the first time, the nurse gets only a single chance to add them all and administer them, from there the patient goes home.</p>
<h2>The doctor</h2>
<p>The doctor then fills in the diagnosis and the disease diagnosed with or requests for lab tests if there is need before filling in the diagnosis or if there is are lab results (the tests from the lab are recieved), the doctor diagnoses accordingly. If the diagnosis is filled, s/he prescribes the meds to be taken and the system updates the waiting list of the pharmacist</p>
<h2>The lab</h2>
<p>The lab takes the neccessary tests and feeds in the results back to the system and the results are posted back to the doctors part where the patient goes back for diagnosis.</p>
<h2>The pharmacy</h2>
<p>The pharmacy just issues the meds prescribed by the doctor and then after clicking a issue button, the system updates and the patient goes home, until next time</p>
